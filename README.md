Project Description It is no longer just a threat; it is now a reality! Zombies have been spotted all over the U.S. Work with your colleagues at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to identify the characteristics and supplies that seem to keep humans safe. Develop a logistic regression model that predicts the probability of becoming a zombie based on personal characteristics like age and sex, type of neighborhood people live in, and what emergency supplies are available. Practice bivariate tests like chi-squared and t-test to identify the most relevant variables for the model, develop and run the model, check model assumptions, and use the model to predict the probability of becoming a zombie for friends, family, and even yourself!  To complete this Project, you should be comfortable with basic data analysis in base R and visualization in ggplot2, and be familiar with chi-squared test, t-tests, and logistic regression.  The zombies dataset was created for this Project based on emergency preparedness recommendations. It consists of 200 observations and 14 variables. The variables include personal characteristics like age and sex, zombie status, a description of the neighborhood each participant lives in, and measures of supplies.
